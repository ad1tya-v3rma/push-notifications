      This project is about pushing data (or notifications) onto the client apps.
      The application is built using a modern, scalable architecture that leverages Apache Kafka, Spring Boot, Node.js with Socket.IO, and Angular. Kafka, serving as a distributed event streaming platform, ensures efficient and real-time data processing and communication between microservices in the backend. Spring Boot provides a robust framework for building the application's RESTful APIs, facilitating seamless integration and easy scalability. On the front end, Angular delivers a dynamic and responsive user interface, ensuring a smooth user experience. Socket.IO, implemented on the Node.js server, enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server, allowing instant updates and notifications. This combination of technologies ensures high performance, real-time interactivity, and a resilient, microservice-based architecture.
